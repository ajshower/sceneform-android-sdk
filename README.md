## Project-Android-Camera Notes

May 6th 2020:  
Emulators need Google play services update to run app.  Get the APK, Google_Play_Services_for_AR_1.16_x86_for_emulator.apk, from https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases and drag and drop the APK on to the running emulated phone to update the Google play services
Next steps are to introduce a text string in to the emulated environment and to capture the text string for processing:  https://developers.google.com/vision/android/getting-started
